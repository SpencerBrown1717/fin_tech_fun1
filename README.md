## API Architecture

The compliance tools are built using:
- **Next.js API Routes**: Core API implementation
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe implementation
- **JSON Schema**: Standardized data structures
- **RESTful APIs**: Communication protocol

## Security Implementation

This implementation follows best practices for secure deployment:

1. **Authentication**:
   - API key authentication for all endpoints
   - JWT token validation for session management
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse

2. **Data Security**:
   - All sensitive data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
   - PII is redacted from logs and traces
   - No sensitive data is stored in client-side code

3. **Access Control**:
   - Role-based permissions for different compliance tools
   - Audit logging for all API access
   - IP-based access restrictions (configurable)

4. **Input Validation**:
   - Strict schema validation for all API inputs
   - Sanitization of user inputs to prevent injection attacks
   - Parameter validation to ensure data integrity

## Integrating with LLMs

The compliance APIs can be integrated with various LLMs including OpenAI's GPT models and Anthropic's Claude.

Example OpenAI integration:

```javascript
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

const tools = [
  {
    type: "function",
    function: {
      name: "analyze_transaction",
      description: "Analyzes financial transactions for compliance issues",
      parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          transaction_id: { type: "string" },
          amount: { type: "number" },
          currency: { type: "string" },
          transaction_type: { type: "string" },
          sender: { 
            type: "object",
            properties: {
              id: { type: "string" },
              name: { type: "string" },
              country: { type: "string" }
            }
          },
          recipient: {
            type: "object",
            properties: {
              id: { type: "string" },
              name: { type: "string" },
              country: { type: "string" }
            }
          },
          purpose: { type: "string" }
        },
        required: ["transaction_id", "amount"]
      }
    }
  }
];

// Call the API with tools
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4-turbo",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Analyze this transaction for compliance issues" }],
  tools: tools,
  tool_choice: "auto"
});
```

## Security Considerations

- **Environment Variables**: All API keys, secrets, and credentials should be stored in environment variables, never in code
- **Authentication**: Use proper authentication for all API endpoints
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities
- **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production environments
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to avoid information leakage
- **Secrets**: Never commit `.env` files or any files containing secrets to version control
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls for all API endpoints
- **Audit Logging**: Maintain comprehensive audit logs for all sensitive operations
