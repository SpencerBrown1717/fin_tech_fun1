# Agentic Fintech Compliance Dashboard

A production-ready, enterprise-grade dashboard showcasing AI-powered financial compliance automation. This application demonstrates how agentic AI systems can transform compliance processes in financial services with unprecedented accuracy, efficiency, and auditability.

## Business Value Proposition

- **Cost Reduction**: 88% reduction in processing time translates to significant operational cost savings
- **Risk Mitigation**: Real-time compliance monitoring reduces regulatory exposure and potential fines
- **Scalability**: Handles 8x the volume of traditional manual review processes
- **Auditability**: Complete decision tracing with blockchain verification ensures regulatory defensibility

## Agentic AI Workflow

This MCP (Minimum Compelling Product) demonstrates the full agentic AI workflow for financial compliance:

1. **Multi-Modal Input Processing**
   - Speech-to-text processing of call recordings with tone analysis
   - Structured data analysis of trade and transaction records
   - Natural language understanding of client communications

2. **Specialized Agent Orchestration**
   - Call Analysis Agent: Monitors for disclosure and suitability issues
   - Trade Verification Agent: Validates transactions against regulatory requirements
   - Complaint Resolution Agent: Analyzes and categorizes client feedback

3. **Decision Intelligence Layer**
   - Multi-model consensus with confidence scoring
   - Dynamic thresholds based on risk profiles
   - Human-in-the-loop escalation for edge cases
   - Complete decision tracing and explanation generation

4. **Continuous Learning System**
   - Feedback loops from human reviewers
   - Regulatory update integration
   - Performance analytics and model refinement

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

This project includes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that exposes financial compliance tools to agentic workflows. The MCP server allows AI agents to access specialized compliance functionality through a standardized interface.

### MCP Features

- **Transaction Analysis**: Analyze financial transactions for compliance issues
- **KYC Verification**: Verify customer KYC compliance status
- **Communication Monitoring**: Analyze customer communications for compliance issues
- **Regulatory Updates**: Get the latest regulatory updates and changes
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate detailed compliance reports

### MCP Architecture

The MCP server is built using:
- **Next.js API Routes**: Core MCP server implementation
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe implementation
- **JSON Schema**: Standardized tool definitions
- **RESTful APIs**: Communication protocol for AI agents

### Secure MCP Implementation

This implementation follows best practices for secure MCP deployment:

1. **Authentication**:
   - API key authentication for all endpoints
   - JWT token validation for session management
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse

2. **Data Security**:
   - All sensitive data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
   - PII is redacted from logs and traces
   - No sensitive data is stored in client-side code

3. **Access Control**:
   - Role-based permissions for different compliance tools
   - Audit logging for all API access
   - IP-based access restrictions (configurable)

4. **Input Validation**:
   - Strict schema validation for all API inputs
   - Sanitization of user inputs to prevent injection attacks
   - Parameter validation to ensure data integrity

### Using the MCP Server

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set environment variables in a `.env.local` file (never commit this file):
   ```
   COMPLIANCE_API_BASE=https://your-compliance-api.com
   COMPLIANCE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   JWT_SECRET=your-secure-random-string
   ```

3. Run the MCP server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   For production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

4. Access the server at http://localhost:3000

### Testing the MCP Server

The project includes test endpoints to verify that the MCP server is working properly:

```bash
# Test the transaction analysis tool
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/compliance/transaction \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"transaction_id":"TX123","amount":10000,"sender":{"id":"S123","name":"John Doe"},"recipient":{"id":"R456","name":"Jane Smith"}}'
```

### Integrating with LLMs

The MCP server can be integrated with various LLMs including OpenAI's GPT models and Anthropic's Claude. See the documentation in `/docs/agentic-workflow.md` for detailed integration examples.

Example OpenAI integration:

```javascript
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

const tools = [
  {
    type: "function",
    function: {
      name: "analyze_transaction",
      description: "Analyzes financial transactions for compliance issues",
      parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          transaction_id: { type: "string" },
          amount: { type: "number" },
          sender: { 
            type: "object",
            properties: {
              id: { type: "string" },
              name: { type: "string" }
            }
          },
          recipient: {
            type: "object",
            properties: {
              id: { type: "string" },
              name: { type: "string" }
            }
          }
        },
        required: ["transaction_id", "amount"]
      }
    }
  }
];

// Call the API with tools
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4-turbo",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Analyze this transaction for compliance issues" }],
  tools: tools,
  tool_choice: "auto"
});
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SpencerBrown1717/fin_tech_fun1.git
   cd fin_tech_fun1
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file with your environment variables:
   ```
   # API Configuration
   COMPLIANCE_API_BASE=https://your-compliance-api.com
   COMPLIANCE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   
   # Security
   JWT_SECRET=your-secure-random-string
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Security Considerations

- All API keys and secrets should be stored in environment variables, never in code
- Use proper authentication for all API endpoints
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Keep dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Implement proper error handling to avoid information leakage
